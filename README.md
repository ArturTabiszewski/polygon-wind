# polygon-wind
Last year I was looking for a wind shader to use on a low poly model, however I couldn't find one that had the visual I was looking for. So I started to develop the Polygon Wind Shader. 

It is supposed to simulate a more suttle organic wind movement on trees (not great for heavy wind effects).
Lately I haven't had much time to work on it, so I decided to publish the source code here and make it available so that anyone can use it.

Here are some videos of what I achieved using it:
